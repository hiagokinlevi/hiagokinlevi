# Hiago Kin Levi

Cyber Ops since 2007. I build defensive security tooling for incident response, DFIR, IAM, AppSec, cloud posture, detection engineering, AI security, containers, secrets, WAFs, phishing monitoring, and applied cryptography.

My current public portfolio is [Cyber Port](https://github.com/hiagokinlevi/Cyber-Port): a 13-repository defensive security ecosystem released under CC BY 4.0.

## Cyber Port Live Activity

<!-- CYBER_PORT_ACTIVITY:START -->
**Last portfolio cycle:** Cycle 95, completed on 2026-04-10  
**Current focus:** `hiagokinlevi-profile`  
**Latest validated adjustment:** profile activity fallback to automation memory when central sync is blocked.

**What changed recently**

- Added automation-memory fallback selection to `scripts/update_cyber_port_activity.py` so the public latest-activity block can reflect the newest validated cycle when `/Users/hiagokin/k1N-Cyber-Port/MEMORY.md` is stale or blocked from updates
- Added regression coverage for newer automation-memory cycle selection in `tests/test_update_cyber_port_activity.py`
- Documented the fallback behavior in the profile `README.md`

**Portfolio status**

- Portfolio backlog: 135 open roadmap items across 13 repositories.
- Next completion-first target: `cloud-posture-watch`.
- License baseline: CC BY 4.0 with attribution.

**Current publish blocker**

- Cloud-posture-watch now has the local Cycle 94 AWS RDS commit 50b6390, but git fetch origin --prune and git push origin main still fail with Could not resolve host: github.com; central k1N-Cyber-Port also remains ahead 105 and behind 7, so target and central publication stay blocked pending safe reconciliation.


**Next visible focus**

- GitHub Actions marketplace action
- Azure SQL encryption and firewall rules
- GCP Cloud SQL public IP and SSL enforcement

**Automation policy**

Cyber Port runs as a continuous automatic improvement loop. Each cycle updates tests, documentation, portfolio memory, central index status, and this profile activity block without requiring manual launch buttons. If publishing is blocked by a Git divergence or remote issue, the automation records the blocker, avoids force-push, and continues with the next safe validation or improvement path.

## Operating Principles

- Defensive and authorized security work only.
- Practical tools with tests, documentation, and repeatable validation.
- Continuous improvement through numbered Cyber Port cycles.
- The profile activity updater can fall back to automation memory when central index sync is blocked, keeping the public latest-activity block aligned with the newest validated cycle.
- Public educational value without malware, exploit kits, bypass guidance, or unsafe abuse workflows.
